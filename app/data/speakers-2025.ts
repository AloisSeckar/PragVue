Yet the needs of our users often don’t fit neatly into the boxes we put them in when we imagine how they use our applications. What if we could take it a step further and build interfaces that adapt on demand to the specific needs of our users? With the power of modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, we can dynamically generate and adapt the UI of our application to meet the exact needs of our users in real-time. In this talk, we explore how to build a single AI-powered component that automatically responds to all UI requirements in a fast and reliable way.',
